# Online Retail II — Data Mining and Analysis Project

This repository contains my work for a graduate-level Data Mining and Analysis project.  
The goal is to explore a real-world retail transaction dataset, apply course techniques (frequent itemsets, association rules), and extend the analysis using beyond-course methods such as sequential pattern mining and statistical association testing.

The dataset used is **Online Retail II**, originally from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Project Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis on a large retail transaction dataset.
- Apply course techniques:
  - Frequent itemsets
  - Association rule mining
- Apply beyond-course techniques:
  - Sequential pattern mining
  - Statistical association tests
- Compare unordered vs. temporal patterns.
- Build a reproducible workflow suitable for a professional portfolio.
